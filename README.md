# Basic Web3 Message Board

This project was developed as part of the @buildspace "Build a Web3 App with Solidity + Ethereum Smart Contracts" course and is deployed on the Rinkeby network.

Users can _"pet"_ my cats by sending a message that is recorded on the blockchain for all users to see. The user has a 50% chance to win some ETH upon sending a message, and must wait at least 15 minutes between messages to prevent spam. In this project, the cat theme refers to my continual NFT cat purchases ðŸ™‚.

The live deployment of this project can be found [here](https://waveportal-baseline-student.lgingerich.repl.co/). It is deployed via Replit and will need to be loaded upon startup. Make sure you are connected to the Rinkeby network when you connect your wallet.
